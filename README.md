# Simple Portfolio Concept
This is a react, react router project using react transition groups.

This project was created with the help from this tutorial [Animated page transitions with React Router 4, ReactTransitionGroup and Animated](https://hackernoon.com/animated-page-transitions-with-react-router-4-reacttransitiongroup-and-animated-1ca17bd97a1a).

## Project Setup

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

After npm install, your project should look like this:

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    manifest.json
    images/
      favicon.ico
      projects/
  src/
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.js
    registerServiceWorker.js
    images/
      logo.svg
    components/
      AnimatedSwitch.js
      AnimatedWrapper.js
      Home.js
      Missed.js
      Projects.js
      TopBar.js
    styles/
      index.css
    utils/
      helpers.js
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.
