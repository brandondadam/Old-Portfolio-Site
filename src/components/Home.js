          My name is Brandon D'Adam. I am a passionate and creative software
          professional who looks forward to getting up everyday, knowing the
          work I deliver will have a positive impact on someone else’s life.
        </p>

          Over the years of developing my craft, I have shaped a unique
          perspective on problem solving that combines the standard design
          thinking process (empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and measure)
          with elements from Disney’s highly creative imagineering design
          principles. I also take the time to understand all aspects that go
          into making a product (feasible, viable, and desirable), as to ensure
          the utmost success of the products I help to deliver.
        </p>

          My craft focuses in product design, and front-end web development. I
          have designed and built quality experiences for a variety of mediums
          over the years including: web, mobile, integrated-hardware, and mixed
          reality interfaces.
