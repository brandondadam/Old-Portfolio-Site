They must be at the control station, in person, looking at the satellite connect computers. The goal of the MOCsat was to give the those responsible for these control stations, the ability to take their satellite feeds on the go, with real-time data and push notification wrapped into a helpful a mobile app.",

So we cut out the possibility of doing just a responsive web app. However, we would not finish the project in our 4 month time frame if we had to build 2 mobile apps, for iOS and Android. That‚Äôs why we decided to use the Ionic Framework. It allowed us to cut down on development time because there was one code base, it gave us the ability to leverage native phone features, plus most of the team already knew javascript. By cutting back on development time, we were also able to allow more time for ux research.",

Everything from how to configure dashboards for missions, to the sizes of the font. Anything that once kept a space engineer, scientist, or student tied down to a control stations can now be accessed anywhere, from their mobile device through a meaningful and helpful interface.",
